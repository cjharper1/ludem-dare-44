1. Add sprites for spikes, cactus, etc.
2. Make spikes bloody when player hits them.
3. Make spikes change player velocity when hit.
4. Play hit animation for player when hitting spikes.
5. Level layouts.
6. Score system.

Long term goals:
1. Implement class to handle animations.
    This would contain the frames that make up an animation and an amount of ticks to play each frame of the animation.
2. Some sort of class/method for swapping current animation of an object by passing an enum value or something.
    This could allow users to queue animations to play after current animation is finished (i.e. after player launch animation finishes, switch to the boost animation).
